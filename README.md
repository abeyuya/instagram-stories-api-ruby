# Instagram Stories API

__First and foremost, this is just an example of what is capable. Do not use this code to spam, cause harm, or otherwise violate the [Instagram API Terms of Use](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/). Don't blame me if Instagram suspends your account. :D__

This is an example of how to access the Instagram Stories API, get your stories, and do what you want with them. I believe in an open internet and having access to the content you create. Hopefully things like this can encourage Instagram to provide more access to their API's and help us create more beautiful things on the web.

## How it works
This API wrapper spoofs the user agent to pretend to be a random Android phone, logs-in, stores cookies, and requests the API.

```ruby
instagram = InstagramStoriesAPI.new()
@user_stories = instagram.get_user_stories()
@stories = instagram.get_stories()
```

## What can I do with it?
I wrote a script hosted on Heroku that polls the API every hour or so and uploads any new Instagram Stories I post to Tumblr so I can keep them around longer. http://kyleturman-instastories.tumblr.com

## Shout outs
Shout out to mgp25's [Instagram-API project](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API). I gleaned a few ideas from how to generate ids and user agents from that project.

Shout out to CaliAlec's [ChromeIGStory project](https://github.com/CaliAlec/ChromeIGStory) for helping me get started the right foot and providing inspiration.
